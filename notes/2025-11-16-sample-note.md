# Sample Note: Knowledge Center Setup Complete

## Overview
This is a sample note to demonstrate the structure and format for adding content to the knowledge center.

## What This Shows
- How to use YAML frontmatter for metadata
- Proper file naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`
- Tag usage for categorization
- Category assignment
- Status tracking (raw → processed → archived)

## How to Use This Template
1. Copy the YAML frontmatter to your new notes
2. Fill in the actual content below
3. Use consistent tags from the approved list
4. Choose a category that fits
5. Keep status as "raw" until you process it

## Next Steps
Once this knowledge center is set up:
1. Start capturing issues and observations in `/notes`
2. Periodically review and expand notes
3. Move processed notes to `/archive` with proper category organization
4. Extract reusable content to guides, templates, or skills
5. Keep syncing with git to all your devices

## Notes
This is a sample and can be deleted once you've started adding your own notes.
